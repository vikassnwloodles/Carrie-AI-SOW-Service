## v3 - May 23 2025

### Added:
1. Added two more empty lines above each section such as "1. Objectives", "2. Scope of Work", "3. Methodology" etc. We are doing this because sometimes "3. " was missing from "3. Methodology". I think GPT was treating "Methodology" section as the part of "2. Scope of Work" section due to a single empty line as a separation between them. Hence increased the no. of empty lines for clear separation between sections.
